= Version upgrade

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
== Description

The `upgrade-provisioner.py` script automates Kubernetes cluster upgrades in the following environments:

- *EKS* on AWS.
- *Azure VMs*.

It allows you to upgrade the Kubernetes cluster version from the version installed by `cloud-provisioner 0.5.X` to that provided by `cloud-provisioner 0.6.X`. To ensure a reproducible runtime environment, the Docker image `stratio-cloud-provisioner-upgrade-image` has been created, which includes the upgrade script and all necessary dependencies.

== Requirements

=== General

* _kubeconfig_ file with access to the cluster.
* _secrets.yml_ file used during cluster creation.
* Installed Docker tool, required to run the container.

=== Permissions

It is essential to xref:operations-manual:installation.adoc[review the documentation] to ensure that no additional permissions are required in the cluster.

== Running the script

=== Building the container

Run the Docker container with the version upgrade image, mounting the required files:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -it -v <secrets.yml path>:/upgrade/secrets.yml -v <kubeconfig path>:/upgrade/.kube/config stratio-cloud-provisioner-upgrade-image:0.6.X
----

=== Using the version upgrade script

Ensure that the working directory includes the following:

* `upgrade-provisioner.py`: main script.
* `templates/`: Jinja2 templates.
