= GCP image builder

This section explains how to build your own images for _Stratio Cloud Provisioner_ https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/capi/providers/gcp[in GCP].

== Prerequisites

=== Global

It is necessary to download the xref:attachment$stratio.tar.gz[Ansible role named "stratio.tar.gz"] for building the image as well as having the following tools installed:

* Packer version ≥ 1.6.0.
* Goss add-on for Packer version ≥ 1.2.0.
* Ansible version ≥ 2.10.0.

If the required binary files are not present, they can be installed in _~/.local/bin_ with the `make deps-ami` command. This directory should be added to your _$PATH_.

=== From Google Cloud Platform

* Create a service account. To do this, follow the steps described in the documentation at https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create#creating[Google Cloud Platform].

* Assign the following permissions to the created service account:

compute.disks.list
compute.disks.use
compute.disks.useReadOnly

compute.machineTypes.get
compute.subnetworks.use
compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp
compute.zoneOperations.get
compute.zones.get
iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
----

* Generate a service account key. To do this, follow the steps described in the documentation at https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete[Google Service Account Key].

* You will need to have Ansible and Packer installed on your system. https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/capi/providers/gcp.html#install-ansible-and-packer:~:text=compliant%20VM%20image.-,Install%20Ansible%20and%20Packer,-Start%20by%20launching[See their documentation] to do this.

* You will also need to have the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[Google Cloud Platform] client installed on the system.

== Image configuration

To build a GCP image, you need to create a single configuration JSON file for Packer. This file contains the configuration parameters for image generation (image configuration, instance type, region, Kubernetes version, etc.).

This is an example descriptor for an Ubuntu 22.04 and Kubernetes 1.26.14 image:

[source,json]
----
{
    "crictl_version": "1.26.1",
    "kubernetes_series": "v1.26",
    "kubernetes_semver": "v1.26.14",
    "kubernetes_deb_version": "1.26.14-1.1",
    "kubernetes_rpm_version": "1.26.14",
    "machine_type": "n2-standard-2",
    "node_custom_roles_post": "stratio"
}
----

Explanation of the parameters:

[%autowidth]
|===
| *crictl_version* | 1.26.1 | Version of the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/tags[cri-tools], follow the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools#compatibility-matrix-cri-tools--kubernetes[compatibility matrix] with the Kubernetes version.
| *kubernetes_series* | v1.26 | Kubernetes version to be installed in the image.
| *kubernetes_semver* | v1.26.14 | Semantic version of Kubernetes to be installed in the image.
| *kubernetes_deb_version* | 1.26.14-1.1 | Debian version of Kubernetes.
| *kubernetes_rpm_version* | 1.26.14 | RPM version of Kubernetes.
| *machine_type* | n2-standard-2 | Instance type for the image build.
| *node_custom_roles_post* | stratio | Custom Ansible role for the node.
|===

The official Image Builder documentation for image configuration can be found at https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/capi/capi.html#customization[customization] and the complete list of parameters at https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/blob/main/images/capi/packer/gce/packer.json[packer.json].

== Image construction

First get the `ID` of the project. To do this, refer to https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects[Identifying projects] or run the `gcloud projects list` command.

Then run the following steps:

. Export the ID of the GCP project in which you want to build the images.
+
[source,console]
----
export GCP_PROJECT_ID=<project-id>
----

. Export the path to the service account credentials created in the previous step.
+
[source,console]
----
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/serviceaccount-key.json>
----

. Clone the _image-builder_ repository if you didn't have it previously.
+
[source,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder.git
cd image-builder
----
+
Or update it if you already had it.
+
[source,console]
----
cd image-builder
git pull
----

. Unpack the Ansible role required for image construction.
+
[source,console]
----
tar zxf stratio.tar.gz
----

. Position in the path _images/capi_ inside the repository.
+
[source,console]
----
cd images/capi
----

. Install the dependencies needed to create the image.
+
[source,console]
----
make deps-gce
----
+
image::deps-gce.png[]

. See the images that can be built.
+
[source,console]
----
make help | grep build-gce
----

. Generate the desired image by passing it the configuration JSON prepared earlier as the `PACKER_VAR_FILES` environment variable and the target of the image to be built. For example, to build an Ubuntu 22.04 image, run:
+
[source,console]
----
PACKER_VAR_FILES=gcp.json make build-gce-ubuntu-2204
----
+
image::build-gce-ubuntu-2204-part1.png[]
+
image::build-gce-ubuntu-2204-part2.png[]

== Debugging

The image creation process can be debugged with the `PACKER_LOG` environment variable.

[source,console]
----
export PACKER_LOG=1
----
