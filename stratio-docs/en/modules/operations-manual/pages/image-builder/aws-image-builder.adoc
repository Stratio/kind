= AWS image builder

This section explains how to build your own images for _Stratio Cloud Provisioner_ https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/capi/providers/aws.html[on AWS].

== Prerequisites

=== Global

It is necessary to download the xref:attachment$stratio.tar.gz[Ansible role named "stratio.tar.gz"] for building the image as well as having the following tools installed:

* Packer version ≥ 1.6.0.
* Goss add-on for Packer version ≥ 1.2.0.
* Ansible version ≥ 2.10.0.

If the required binary files are not present, they can be installed in _~/.local/bin_ with the `make deps-ami` command. This directory should be added to your _$PATH_.

=== From AWS

You need to have:

* An AWS account with a https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/capi/providers/aws.html#configuration:~:text=Required%20Permissions%20to%20Build%20the%20AWS%20AMIs[IAM user with the minimum permissions required to create an image].
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html[AWS CLI] installed and configured.
* A default VPC for the AWS user.
* A key pair for SSH connection to the instance.
* A security group allowing traffic on port 22 for the TCP protocol.

== Image configuration

To build an AWS image, you need to create a single configuration JSON file for Packer. This file contains the configuration parameters for image generation (image configuration, instance type, region, Kubernetes version, etc.).

This is an example descriptor for an Ubuntu 22.04 and Kubernetes 1.26.14 image:

[source,json]
----
{
    "crictl_version": "1.26.1",
    "kubernetes_series": "v1.26",
    "kubernetes_semver": "v1.26.14",
    "kubernetes_deb_version": "1.26.14-1.1",
    "kubernetes_rpm_version": "1.26.14",
    "builder_instance_type": "t3.medium",
    "node_custom_roles_post": "stratio",
    "ansible_extra_vars": "pinned_debs=\"cloud-init=23.1.2-0ubuntu0~22.04.1\"",
    "associate_public_ip_address": "true",
    "ssh_interface": "public_ip",
    "aws_region": "eu-west-1",
    "ami_regions": "eu-west-1",
    "aws_security_group_ids": "sg-0bae9383628c59c25",
    "ssh_keypair_name": "stratio",
    "ssh_private_key_file": "/home/stratio/.ssh/id_ed25519"
}
----

The official Image Builder documentation for image configuration can be found at https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/capi/capi.html#customization[customization] and the complete list of parameters at https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/blob/main/images/capi/packer/ami/packer.json[packer.json].

== Image construction

. Clone the _image-builder_ repository if you didn't have it previously.
+
[source,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder.git
cd image-builder
----
+
Or update it if you already had it.
+
[source,console]
----
cd image-builder
git pull
----

. Unpack the Ansible role required for image construction.
+
[source,console]
----
tar zxf stratio.tar.gz
----

. Position yourself in the _images/capi_ path inside the repository.
+
[source,console]
----
cd images/capi
----

. Install the dependencies needed to create the image.
+
[source,console]
----
make deps-ami
----
+
image::desp-ami.png[]

. See the images that can be built.
+
[source,console]
----
make help | grep build-ami
----

. Generate the desired image by passing it the configuration JSON prepared earlier as the `PACKER_VAR_FILES` environment variable and the target of the image to be built. For example, to build an Ubuntu 22.04 image, run:
+
[source,console]
----
PACKER_VAR_FILES=aws.json make build-ami-ubuntu-2204
----
+
image::build-ami-ubuntu-2204-part1.png[]
+
image::build-ami-ubuntu-2204-part2.png[]
+
image::amis.png[]

== Debugging

The image creation process can be debugged with the `PACKER_LOG` environment variable.

[source,console]
----
export PACKER_LOG=1
----

==== Frequent errors

* *VPCIdNotSpecified: no default VPC for this user*.
+
To fix it, edit the _images/capi/packer/packer/ami/packer.json_ file and modify the value of the `vpc_id` variable with the ID of the default VPC of your AWS account. To get that value you must navigate to the 'VPC' section of the AWS console and copy the _VPC ID_ from the 'Details' tab.
+
image::vpc-id.png[]

* *"`subnet_id` or `subnet_filter` must be provided for non-default VPCs"*
+
To fix this, edit the _images/capi/packer/packer/ami/packer.json_ file and modify the value of the `subnet_id` variable to the ID of a subnet of the VPC specified in the `vpc_id` variable.

* *"Timeout waiting for SSH"*
+
Follow these steps to fix it:
+
. Edit the file _images/capi/packer/packer/ami/packer.json_ and modify the value of the variable `ssh_keypair_name` to the SSH key name.
+
[source,json]
----
"ssh_keypair_name": "my-ssh-keypair"
----
+
. Modify the value of the `ssh_private_key_file` variable by the path to the SSH private key file.
+
[source,json]
----
"ssh_private_key_file": "/home/user/.ssh/my-ssh-keypair.pem"
----
+
. The VM must have a public IP to be able to connect to it. If it does not have one, you can create it for the instance by editing the _images/capi/packer/packer/ami/packer.json_ file and modifying/adding the value of the `associate_public_ip_address` variable to _true_ in the 'builders' section.
+
[source,json]
----
"associate_public_ip_address": "true"
----
+
. Create/assign a security group (with permissions to port 22) to the created instance (on the same network as this one) and modify/add the value of the `security_group_id` variable with the ID of the created/assigned security group in the _images/capi/packer/packer/ami/packer.json_ file in the 'builders' section.
+
[source,json]
----
"security_group_id": "sg-1234567890"
----
+
image::security-group.png[]
+
. Add the variable `ssh_interface` = "public_ip" in the 'builders' section of the _images/capi/packer/packer/ami/packer.json_ file to connect to the instance by the private IP.
+
[source,json]
----
"ssh_interface": "public_ip"
----
+
. Create an _internet gateway_ and a _route table_ (or use the default one) for your AWS account's VPC and associate them.
