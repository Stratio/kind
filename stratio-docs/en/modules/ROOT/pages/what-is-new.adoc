= What's new

The main new features in this version of _Stratio Cloud Provisioner_ are:

* CoreDNS replicas are now distributed across different nodes to improve availability.
* Default volumes are created for containerd, etcd, and the system root if they are not specified in the _keoscluster_ configuration.
* Support for Kubernetes 1.30. Versions older than 1.28 are now marked as deprecated.
* Tigera Operator has been updated to version 3.28.2.
* A new option, "use-local-stratio-image", has been added to allow reuse of local images.
