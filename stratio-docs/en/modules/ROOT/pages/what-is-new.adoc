= What's new

The main new features in this version of _Stratio Cloud Provisioner_ are:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Added support for Kubernetes 1.32.
* Updated _cluster-operator_ (v0.5.2), Flux (v2.14.1), and Tigera Operator (v3.29.1).

== Compatibility breakage

Starting with this version, the Docker registry and the Helm repository are set to private by default. You can change this behavior in the cluster’s `ClusterConfig` object by using the `private_registry` and `private_helm_repo` attributes.
=======
* CoreDNS replicas are now distributed across different nodes to improve availability.
* Support for Kubernetes 1.30. Versions older than 1.28 are now marked as deprecated.
* Tigera Operator has been updated to version 3.28.2.
* A new option, "use-local-stratio-image", has been added to allow reuse of local images.
